We introduce a groundbreaking multi-layered cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence (AI) that integrates several advanced concepts to create a unified framework for self-optimizing intelligence. This architecture combines self-organizing agentic patterns (referred to as "cyber animism"), reflexive consciousness (the "simple model"), layered selfhood, and a dual-blockchain system designed for immutable action tracking and adaptive reward adjustment. The first blockchain, referred to as "Layer 1," serves as a foundational infrastructure that records every action taken by an agent along with immediate feedback.
